## Setting up

The SQOD API reference guide describes how to interact with SQOD using REST APIs. This enables external applications to access functions included as part of the SQOD platform.
We recommend that you test your integration with the support of Involve and abide by any limits and ensure sensible use of the platform. Involve will provide a sandbox where you can test your integration development before you connect to production servers

## Onboarding

As part of your onboarding Involve will provide key information to allow you to access your environment using the API.

The information provided will include:
- URL
- Client ID
- Client Secret

Once these details have been provided, you can authenticate against the SQOD platform
